## Pull Request Review Comments Collection

### Details

I provided a pull request to my team and it was reviewed.
I want to collect the comments of one of the reviewers. Here are the details:

- pull request link: link_to_pr
- reviewer github name: reviewer_github_name

### Task

Please do the following for each comment by this reviewer:

1. Create a short title that summarizes the comment, no more than 6 words
2. Provide the link to the comment below that
3. Add the full comment text below the title in comment style
4. Provide the diff to which the comment refers, if available

Here is an example:

    ## Title of the comment

    [Link to comment](<link to comment>)

    > First line of comment text.
    > Second line of comment text.

    ```diff
    <some code diff here>
    ```


Write the results to the following file:

- path_to_comments_file

### Notes

You do not need to read any local files to accomplish this task.
All needed information is provided in the PR and the comments.
